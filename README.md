# Unreal Vault Organizer using Electron (unreal_vault_organizer)

Organize your unreal vault plugins

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
npm start
# or
npm run debug
```

A simple application that downloads your unreal vault inventory and allows you to organize it by tags.  In addition it will notify you when you have updates for a plugin.  You can then sort by updates to determine which plugins have updates available(still testing this)

Please watch video for installation instructions.  You will need to install the free version of Fiddler Classic from telerik.
